## Recent Updates (July 2026)

- **Uploaded Project Photos Integrated**: All real bathroom transformation photos from business uploads (IMG_*.jpg and project shots) now live in the Transformation Gallery with branded captions highlighting All-Star Shower System tiers (Premier, Signature, Designer), Walk-In Tubs, specific Central Arkansas locations, and "Verified Project" badges.

## Webflow Migration Guide (Full Build Instructions)

Since you asked for the **full Webflow build**, here is the complete migration path:

### Why Webflow?
- Best matches your detailed Visual Sitemap and Content Plan
- Excellent performance and SEO
- Easy to maintain without developers
- Powerful CMS for locations and blog
- Native support for schema and animations

### Migration Steps:

1. **Sign up for Webflow** (webflow.com) - Start with a free plan or Site plan.

2. **Create New Site**
   - Choose "Blank Site" or "Start from scratch"

3. **Import Structure**
   - Use Webflow's **Pages** panel to create all pages matching this structure:
     - Home
     - Bathroom Remodeling
     - Locations (create collection or individual pages)
     - Services (sub-services)
     - Content pages (FAQ, About, etc.)
     - Blog

4. **Copy Content**
   - Copy text from the HTML files into Webflow text elements
   - Use **Rich Text** elements for formatted content
   - For the **3-Tier Comparison Tool**: Recreate it using Webflow's grid + components (very easy - 3 columns with cards)

5. **Design System**
   - Use the visual style from the static site (clean, modern, emerald accents)
   - Set up **Styles** panel for consistent typography, colors, buttons

6. **Add Interactions**
   - Add hover effects on service cards
   - Smooth scroll to consultation section

7. **CMS Setup (Powerful Feature)**
   - Create **Collections**:
     - Locations (for dynamic location pages)
     - Blog Posts
   - This allows you to manage content in Webflow CMS instead of editing HTML

8. **Schema & SEO**
   - Webflow has built-in SEO settings
   - Add custom code for JSON-LD schema (copy from `references/schema-markup-library.md`)

9. **Forms & Lead Magnets**
   - Use Webflow Forms connected to email or Zapier
   - Lead magnets can link to Google Drive or use Webflow's file hosting

10. **Publish**
    - Connect custom domain
    - Publish to staging then live

**Estimated Time:** 4-8 hours for a designer familiar with Webflow (or I can provide more detailed component-by-component instructions if needed).

**Pro Tip:** Use the static HTML files as your **design reference** while building in Webflow. You can even use Webflow's "Paste HTML" in some elements.

## WordPress Migration Guide (Full Build Instructions)

### Recommended Approach for WordPress

**Best Stack:**
- Theme: **GeneratePress** (lightweight + fast) or **Bricks Builder** (visual like Webflow)
- Page Builder: **Bricks** or **GenerateBlocks** + Spectra
- Forms: **Fluent Forms** or **WPForms**
- SEO: **Rank Math** or **Yoast**
- Caching: **LiteSpeed Cache** or **WP Rocket**

### Migration Steps:

1. **Install WordPress** on your hosting (SiteGround, Cloudways, or Kinsta recommended for speed)

2. **Install Recommended Theme & Plugins**
   - Theme: GeneratePress or Bricks
   - Page Builder: Bricks (visual) or Elementor (easier but heavier)
   - SEO: Rank Math
   - Forms: Fluent Forms
   - Security: Wordfence or Solid Security

3. **Create Pages**
   - Home
   - Bathroom Remodeling
   - All 7 Location pages (use custom fields or ACF for location-specific content)
   - Service pages
   - Content pages

4. **Import Content**
   - Copy text from HTML files
   - Use **Gutenberg blocks** or Bricks elements
   - Recreate the **3-Tier Comparison** as a nice card grid with buttons

5. **Location Pages Strategy**
   - Use **Custom Post Type** "Locations" with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
   - Or create individual pages for simplicity

6. **Blog**
   - Use WordPress Posts
   - Create categories: "Voice Search Tips", "Bathroom Remodeling", etc.

7. **Lead Magnets**
   - Use Fluent Forms or Thrive Leads
   - Deliver PDFs via email (use FluentCRM or MailerLite)

8. **Schema**
   - Use Rank Math's schema features (very powerful)
   - Or add custom code for JSON-LD

9. **Performance**
   - Enable caching
   - Optimize images (use ShortPixel or Imagify)
   - Use CDN if needed

10. **Domain & SSL**
    - Point domain to hosting
    - SSL is usually free with modern hosts

**Time Estimate:** 6-12 hours depending on builder used.

**Recommendation:** If you want something closer to Webflow's power, use **Bricks Builder**. It's the closest visual experience to Webflow in WordPress.
